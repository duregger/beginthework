Drawing from real-world implementations across different industries, we explore the psychological, cultural, and practical barriers that prevent AI from reaching its potential impact.",

        "longDescription": "Based on the essay 'The Future of Work Is Post-Digital,' this lecture explores the fundamental shift from digital to post-digital work. Students will examine three emerging models for thriving in an AI-dominated economy: 1) Value from Curation, Not Creation - learning to assess quality at scale and separate signal from noise; 2) Monetizing Taste, Trust, and Authority - developing distinct POV and aesthetic language as monetizable assets; 3) Coordinating Systems and Human Networks - becoming system-level thinkers who arrange conditions for value emergence. The lecture addresses the transition from specialization to orchestration, where the ability to guide both human and artificial intelligence becomes the new essential skill. Students will explore how to navigate education and career preparation when traditional roles are being automated, focusing on building trust, developing taste, and becoming translators between disciplines and stakeholders.",
